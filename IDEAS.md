## Ideas

- Use the LCD custom character feature to create an animated storm/twister/tornado that is cycled through its (8?) frames as part of the display update process during normal operation
    - Place the animating character alongside the CallStorm device name

- While in operational mode, so not in menu mode, when the encoder knob is turned, increase/decrease the current setting for _maximum enabled relays_ allowing a quick way to dial up or down device activity without entering the menu system
    - When the allow relays count is reduced, there is no need to immediately shut down any running ringers in excess of the max (for instance, if it's dialed back to zero, there's no need to shut all of them off immediately), just let them naturally finish their ringing cycle

- While in Menu Mode, _long pressing_ the encoder button should be a quick shortcut for "Save & Exit"

- While in Operation mode, _Long pressing_ the encoder button should activate  a secret feature that that sets all the options for the effect of **maximum chaos and ringing**: all relays enabled, all allowed to be concurrently running, with the minimum setting for call frequency.
